This isn't my first time trying to learn the Java programming language but it's the first time the language has actually made sense to me. Absolutely worth every minute.

Really enjoyed this course by Angie. I think the way she explains it is really clear if you're coming with no knowledge about the language. She's also super fun. Totally recommended!

If Statement
If Statement
00:17:33 - 00:24:01
Angie discusses the function of an if statement and walks through coding an example if statement. If statements must evaluate to true or false and will apply if the defined condition is met.

Angie adds an else statement to the previously created if statement which will be applied if the condition is not met.
Nested If Statement
Nested If Statement
00:29:59 - 00:36:41
Angie demonstrates nesting multiple logic paths in an if statement to check for a condition, and if that condition is met, then check for another condition. If-else-if statements can also be used in decisions with more than one path.
Switch Statements
Switch Statements
00:36:42 - 00:48:44
Angie discusses using switch statements instead of if-else-if to check conditionals. Unlike if-else-if statements, switch statements check for equality.
Switch Expressions
Switch Expressions
00:48:45 - 00:56:37
Angie demonstrates switch expressions, which are similar to switch statements, but allow values to be directly assigned when a case is matched.
Operators

Do While Loops
Do While Loops
01:12:06 - 01:20:49
Angie demonstrates repeatedly running a program while a condition is being met using a do while loop. Student questions regarding valid boolean responses and if data from the loop can be used the next time it runs are also covered in this segment.
For Loop
For Loop
01:20:50 - 01:27:58
Angie walks through creating a program that will scan a given number of items and keep a running total. A for loop will run a specified number of times and the condition is tested before entering the loop.
Nested Loop
Nested Loop
01:27:59 - 01:32:11
Angie discusses nested loops as a loop inside a loop where the inner loop will execute once for each iteration of the outer loop. A student question regarding how to decide how deeply nested loops should be is also covered in this segment.
Methods, Objects & Data Types
Section Duration: 1 hour, 25 minutes
Methods
Methods
01:32:12 - 01:39:30

Instantiating Objects
Instantiating Objects
02:23:46 - 02:33:07
Angie walks through writing a class that creates instances of the Rectangle class to find the total area of two rooms in a house. Student questions regarding how the HomeAreaCalculator knows to reference Rectangle and if objects can contain other types of objects are also covered in this segment.

Records & Wrapper Classes
Records & Wrapper Classes
02:45:56 - 02:57:42
Angie discusses using record classes for simple objects to reduce boilerplate code. Wrapper classes can be used to represent some primitive data types as objects and allow the variable to be operated on by methods.
Arrays & Text Processing
Section Duration: 1 hour, 1 minute

Angie demonstrates overriding the behavior of a method inherited by a subclass. Changing the superclass variable's access modifier from private to protected will allow subclasses to access that variable while retaining encapsulation.
Overloading Methods
Overloading Methods
04:24:38 - 04:31:51
Angie walks through overloading methods that were inherited from a superclass. Student questions regarding whether constructors need to be set to public and whether there are any differences between overloading inherited and non-inherited methods are also covered in this segment.
Chain of Inheritance
Chain of Inheritance
04:31:52 - 04:37:54
Angie discusses restrictions of inheritance between classes, including classes inheriting from only one superclass. A walkthrough of an example chain of classes is also provided in this segment.
Limiting Access & Access Modifiers
Limiting Access & Access Modifiers
04:37:55 - 04:42:36
Angie discusses limited member access with inheritance, such as public, protected, and final members being inherited, but final methods cannot be overridden. When overriding an inherited method, the access modifier must be the same or less strict than the superclass.
Sealed Classes
Sealed Classes
04:42:37 - 04:51:42
Angie demonstrates restricting inheritance to specific classes using sealed classes. The NonSealed keyword is also briefly discussed in this segment.

Type Casting
Type Casting
05:00:08 - 05:09:54
Angie discusses converting an object's type into another via type casting and demonstrates how to downcast a type. When casting types, the objects must be related in the inheritance hierarchy tree.

Abstraction
Abstraction
05:22:18 - 05:39:42
Angie discusses one of object-oriented programming's core principles, abstraction, using structures to represent abstract ideas. Abstract classes are designed to be implemented by their subclasses.
Interfaces
Interfaces
05:39:43 - 05:47:48
Angie discusses interfaces as stateless constructs with abstract behaviors and demonstrates creating an interface and a class that implements it. By default, methods in interfaces are considered abstract.
Multiple Inheritance
Multiple Inheritance
05:47:49 - 06:00:06
Angie demonstrates how classes achieve multiple inheritance by implementing multiple interfaces. An example of an interface method using the default type is also covered in this segment.
Data Structures
Section Duration: 1 hour, 10 minutes
Set
Set
06:00:07 - 06:13:30
Angie briefly overviews data structures and discusses an unordered collection of unique objects called Set. Adding data to a Set using the Set.of method will make the Set immutable.
List
List
06:13:31 - 06:26:52
Angie demonstrates how to define a collection of ordered elements accessible by position, also known as a List. Replacing items in an array list using .set and removing an item using .remove are also covered in this segment.
Queue
Queue
06:26:53 - 06:32:44
Angie demonstrates how to define a queue, a collection of elements that are processed in the order in which they are added. When a new item is added to a queue, it is added to the end of the array.
Map
Map
06:32:45 - 06:44:22
Angie discusses Maps as unordered unique key-value pairs that do not inherit from the collection interface. The put and putIfAbsent operators and how to set immutable objects are also covered in this segment.
Collection Iterators
Collection Iterators
06:44:23 - 06:50:19
Angie demonstrates looping through a Set. List, or Queue collection using an iterator. Map can be looped through using entrySet() to gain access to iterator.

Functional Interfaces & Streams
Section Duration: 47 minutes
Functional Interfaces
Functional Interfaces
07:10:39 - 07:20:37
Angie discusses functional programming in Java by utilizing the java.util.function package to access several functional interfaces. A functional interface is an interface with a single abstract method which can be implemented by lambda expressions and method references.
Streams Overview
Streams Overview
07:20:38 - 07:25:00
Angie discusses streams, a sequence of elements from a data source, that can be accessed by using the java.util.stream package. An overview of intermediate and terminal stream operations is also covered in this segment.
anyMatch, allMatch, & filter
anyMatch, allMatch, & filter
07:25:01 - 07:37:38
Angie demonstrates using the anyMatch, allMatch, and filter operations to return the desired data from an array of strings. The filter operation allows for a more precise return in that it will only return items that match the given condition.
map & reduce
map & reduce
07:37:39 - 07:49:36
Angie demonstrates the stream operations map and reduce, which allow manipulation of the data within the stream. Examples using both strings and integers are provided in this segment.

Checked & Unchecked Exceptions
Checked & Unchecked Exceptions
08:04:49 - 08:08:44
Angie discusses the two categories of exceptions, checked and unchecked, and the differences between the two. Check exceptions are exceptions that are checked by the compiler, while unchecked exceptions are not checked by the compiler.

Angie demonstrates flagging errors within code by manually throwing exceptions. The thrown error messages can be customized or left as default.
Rethrow Exceptions
Rethrow Exceptions
08:47:55 - 08:53:28
Angie walks through how to rethrow an exception to avoid catching the exception in a try catch block.
Wrapping Up
Section Duration: 2 minutes
Wrapping Up
Wrapping Up
08:53:29 - 08:56:09
Angie wraps up the course by answering student questions regarding resources for finding bugs and if there is a preference for where the print statement is located in a stream.
